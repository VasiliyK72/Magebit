To install a website on a web server, you need to download the archive of all files and unzip them in the root directory of your server.
Create database dbname = magebit
Create user = user_magebit
Come up with a password.
Enter all these values into the file: config.php

After that, import the database from the file: subscribing.sql

Everything worked out successfully. The website should start up.
The main page of the site is available, this is: index.html
And a page for the administrator: list.html

On the list.html page I made sorting emails by date, name and gmail domain.
